		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		
			<p>In this page I will be evaluating two contrasting webpages based on the CRAP Principles of web design.
			C.R.A.P Principles:
			<br>
			<b>C</b>ontrast
			<br>
			<b>R</b>epetition
			<br>
			<b>A</b>lignment
			<br>
			<b>P</b>roximity </p>
			
			
		
			<h3>Website 1: Google <a href= "https://www.google.com/"> Google's Main page </a> </h3>
			<img class= "standard" src="https://webpages.uncc.edu/jlair1/itis3135/images/google.png" alt="Google search engine"/>
			<p>The google brand is a household name for the most widely used search engine. 
			The google company spans throughout many products and platforms, however for this assignment I will be anaylzing the google search page</p>
			
			<p><b> Contrast:</b> Google uses a clean simplistic background, it's completely white with gray text that contrasts it's white background.
			It's easy to read, and all the elements stand out. The search bar pops to the users eyes. </p>
			
			
			<p><b>Repetion:</b> The signature google branding is subtle, but present. Google has it's signature blue color outlining the sign in button
			and the blue and red microphone icon in the search box. This color format and layout is present throughout all the pages along with 
			the flare of changing the actual "GOOGLE" logo to whatever is relevant to that day.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Alignment:</b> All the elements in the page are well organized, and lined up. The center of the page is the search bar with 
			the buttons directly centered beneath it, and the google logo centered above it. Drawing the users eyes into a straight 
			line directly to the middle of the page. The other elements of the page such as the sign in button are kept aligned to 
			the top and bottom of the page respectively.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Proximity:</b> Google contains similar elements in small offshoots in the header and footer, 
			along with the main content and body of the page front and center. All of the lesser used elements are kept at the bottom 
			of the page such as the privacy and terms pages, and the more commonly used elements are kept with similar parts, such as the sign 
			in buttom beside the gmail and images sections.</p>
			
		
		
		
			<h3> Website 2: Craigslist <a href= "https://charlotte.craigslist.org/"> Craigslist's Charlotte page </a> </h3>
			<img class= "standard" src="https://webpages.uncc.edu/jlair1/itis3135/images/craigslist.png" alt="craigslist homepage"/>
			
			<p> The craigslist website is a forum like hub for the trading and buying of local goods and services. It  
			requires the user to submit very little information and is mostly anonymous for posting and answering ads.</p>
			
			<p><b>Contrast:</b> The majority of craigslist content consists of 3 colors, blue, gray, and white. The content is laid out 
			in such a way that it blends all together. The text is all lowercase and jumbled together with varying sizes. It's  
			difficult for a user to make note of any significant element that stands out.</p>
			
			<p><b>Repetion:</b> Craigslist does maintain a consistency and repetition throughout it's website. The colors, text, and font 
			are repeated throughout all pages.</p>

			<p><b>Alignment:</b> Craigslist is lacking in the alignment principals, it atleast maintains clean lines between sections vertically.
			However, when it breaks off into subsections such as "community" "services" .. ect there is a lack of consistency in their placement, 
			almost as if the sections were pasted randomly, and in the subsections you have a wide range of options leaving the subsections with a jumbled look
			of inconsistency and disorganization.</p>
			
			<p><b>Proximity:</b> The consistent theme in my analysis of jumbled and disorganized maintains true in the proximity. In every subsection of the website  
			there is a clustered feeling, almost as there is too much content placed in each area for the size of the area. For example the sidebars, the right sidebar 
			contains a section of nearby craigslist website links, in which there are so many links with similiar formatting that it just becomes a wordjumble of small lower
			case citynames with no discerning elements, a user would have to squint and carefully read each word to try and find an area they are looking for. This remains a 
			consistent theme in all other sections of the website as well.</p>
