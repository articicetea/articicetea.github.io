		<h2>Smith's Custom Jewelry</h2>
		
		<h3>Project Overview</h3>
		<p>The application i'm designing will be an addendum to a jewelry store. The store currently provides an online
		shop for their current stocked jewelry, along with jewelry available for order. However, I will be designing a site 
		that adds an additional functionality to allow the website user to order custom made jewelry based on their specifications. 
		The website will include examples of previously designed jewelry, a tutorial on how to design the jewelry, and an interface to actually 
		create the design.</p>

		<h3>Dynamic Functionality on the website:</h3>
		<p>This website is going to be used by customers that are interested in designing their own custom jewelry from Smith's 
		Jewelry. Within the site they will have interactive photos of previously created custom jewelry, and photos of the mockup
		of their custom jewelry design. It will also include an interactive jewelry design interface that will accept input from the user 
		through the use of forms and selection boxes to create the design of their choice, and it will output a mockup of their jewelry design.</p>
